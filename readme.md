**THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. IT WILL NOT BE UPDATED FOR BETA 8**

Webpack supports dynamic importing of modules, but it's finnicky and expensive. This is no longer by any means a practical approach to ad hoc frontend adjustments. I'm looking into other ways that won't require a full-on extension, but they will likely be DOM-oriented and therefore probably won't require support from an extension themselves.
